# Squire AI Context

## Purpose

- This file is a durable handoff for future fresh-context agents.
- Keep only need-to-know decisions, constraints, and loose ends that materially affect future work.

## Product Scope (Current)

- Primary runtime interface is Discord.
- Primary LLM provider is OpenAI.
- Natural-language command routing is in active use for read and mutation intents.
- High-level future ideas belong in `.agent/future-plans.md`.

## Core Invariants

- Raw events are immutable; derived artifacts are versioned; canonical objects are mutable source-of-truth.
- Explicit `!` commands have highest precedence.
- `!clear-archive` + `DELETE`, `!confirm`, and `!cancel` remain explicit-only controls.
- Mutation writes stay confirmation-first unless explicitly designed otherwise.
- Canonical object audit linkage (`source_event_ids`, `last_decision_id`) must be preserved.

## Durable Runtime Decisions

### Numbered Mutation UX

- `!done`, `!append`, and `!fix` support `<id|number>` targets.
- Numbered targets resolve from the latest numbered cursor in user/channel context.
- Cursor sources include `!recent`, `!find`, `!status`, and `!weekly`.
- Thread-parent fallback is implemented so numbered follow-ups from thread replies resolve correctly.

### Matching and Retrieval

- Hybrid lexical + semantic retrieval is active with conservative defaults.
- Deterministic auto-apply gates include minimum score and margin checks.
- When retrieval is degraded/unavailable, runtime follows safe fallbacks (no unsafe auto-apply).

### Test-Mode Startup

- `SQUIRE_ENV=test` runs destructive reset + deterministic seed + index rebuild.
- Guardrails require a test-safe archive path.
- `test_archive_root` can override `archive_root` only in test mode.

## Natural-Language Routing (Current Contract)

- Runtime uses route schema `nl_route_intent_v1` and mutation schemas `nl_mutation_plan_v1` / `nl_mutation_normalized_v1`.
- Default natural-language routing prompt is `config/prompts/nl_command_routing_v1.txt`.

### Mutation Plan Behavior

- Mutation plans support multi-operation and multi-target requests.
- Runtime normalizes per target and assigns operation status:
  - `resolved`
  - `unresolved`
  - `cancelled_unresolved`
- Conflicting writes on the same target+field are marked `operation_conflict`.
- Pending actions are created from resolved operations only.
- Confirm/apply path supports mixed object-type batches (`pending.object_type = "mixed"`).

### Clarification Policy

- One-turn clarification only.
- Clarification scope is immutable and limited to unresolved operations.
- Out-of-scope clarification replies are blocked with required policy copy.
- If unresolved operations remain after the one clarification turn, they are cancelled.

### NL Routing Config Surface

- Active keys:
  - `enabled`
  - `clarify_on_ambiguous`
  - `allow_nl_mutations`
  - `plan_trace_enabled`
  - `read_auto_min_confidence`
  - `mutation_confirm_min_confidence`
  - `max_recent_limit`
- Removed keys (do not reintroduce without explicit decision):
  - `mutation_plan_enabled`
  - `plan_auto_aliasing`

## Known Constraints and Loose Ends

- Clarification context is in-memory runtime state and does not persist across process restarts.
- Plan-size guardrails (max operations per plan / max targets per operation) are intentionally deferred for now.
  - Track this in `.agent/future-plans.md` under routing hardening.
